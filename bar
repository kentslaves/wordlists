Q: A law was passed declaring Mt. Karbungko as a protected area since it as a major watershed.
The protected area covered a portion located in Municipality A of the Province I and a portion located in the City of Z of Province II. Maingat is the leader of Samahan ng Tagapag-ingat ng Karbungko (STK), a people's organization. He learned that a portion of the mountain located in the City of Z of Province II was extremely damaged when it was bulldozed and levelled to the ground, and several trees and plants were cut down and burned by workers of World Pleasure Resorts, Inc. (WPRI) for the construction of a hotel and golf course. Upon inquiry with the project site engineer if they had a permit for the project, Maingat was shown a copy of the Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) issued by the DENR-EMB, Regional Director (RD-DENR-EMB).
Immediately, Maingat and STK filed a petition for the issuance of a writ of continuing mandamus against RD-DENR-EMB and WRI with the RTC of Province I, a designated environmental court, as the RD-DENR-EMB negligently issued the ECC to WRI.
On scrutiny of the petition, the court determined that the area where the alleged actionable neglect or omission subject of the petition took place in the City of Z of Province Il, and therefore cognizable by the RTC of Province Il. Thus, the court dismissed outright the petition for lack of jurisdiction. (2015 BAR)

A. Was the court correct in motu proprio dismissing the petition?
A: NO. The court was not correct in motu propio dismissing the petition for lack of jurisdiction. In a case, the Supreme Court held that the requirement that the petition be filed in the area where the actionable neglect or omission took place. (Sec. 2, Rule 8, Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases) relates to venue and not to subject-matter jurisdiction. Since what is involved is improper venue and not subject-matter jurisdiction, it was wrong for the court to dismiss outright the petition since venue may be waived.
(Central Bar Q&A by Riguera, 2024)

B. Assuming that the court did not dismiss the petition, the RD-DENR-EMB in his Comment moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that petitioners failed to appeal the issuance of
and to exhaust administrative
remedies provided in the DENR Rules and Regulations.
Should the court dismiss the petition?

A: NO, the court should not dismiss the petition. The Supreme Court has held that in environmental cases, the defense of failure to exhaust administrative remedies by appealing the ECC issuance would apply only if the defect in the issuance of the ECC does not have any causal relation to the environmental damage. Here the issuance of the ECC has a direct causal relation to the environmental damage since it permitted the bulldozing of a portion of the mountain and the cutting down and burning of several trees and plants. Hence the defense of failure to appeal the ECC and to exhaust administrative remedies would not apply.

Q: Regional Director AG of the Department of Public Works and Highways was charged with violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 in the Office of the Ombudsman. An administrative charge for gross misconduct arising from the transaction subject matter of said criminal case was filed against him in the same office. The Ombudsman assigned a team composed of investigators from the Office of the Special Prosecutor and from the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Military to conduct a joint investigation of the criminal case and the administrative case. The team of investigators recommended to the Ombudsman that AG be preventively suspended for a period not exceeding six months on its finding that the evidence of guilt is strong. The Ombudsman issued the said order as recommended by the investigators.
AG moved to reconsider the order on the following grounds:
	a	﻿﻿﻿﻿the Office of the Special Prosecutor had exclusive authority to conduct a preliminary investigation of the criminal case;
	b	﻿﻿﻿﻿the order for his preventive suspension was premature because he had yet to file his answer to the administrative complaint and submit countervailing evidence; and
	c	﻿﻿﻿﻿he was a career executive service officer and under Presidential Decree No. 807 (Civil Service Law), his preventive suspension shall be for a maximum period of three months.
Resolve with reasons the motion of respondent AG.
(2005 BAR)
A: The motion should be denied for the following reasons:
	1	﻿﻿﻿The Office of the Special Prosecutor does not have exclusive authority to conduct a preliminary investigation of the criminal case but it participated in the investigation together with the Deputy Ombudsman for the Military who can handle cases of civilians and is not limited to the military.
	2	﻿﻿﻿The order of preventive suspension need not wait for the answer to the administrative complaint and the submission of countervailing evidence. (Garcia v. Mojica, G.R. No. 13903, September 10, 1999)
In Vasquez case, G.R. No. 110801, April 6, 1995, the court ruled that preventive suspension pursuant to Sec. 24 of R.A. No. 6770 (Ombudsman Act of 1989), shall continue until termination of the case but shall not exceed six (6) months, except in relation to R.A. No, 3019 and P.D. No. 807. As a career executive officer, his preventive suspension under the Civil Service Law may only be for a maximum period of three months. The period of the suspension under the Anti-Graft Law shall be the same pursuant to the equal protection clause. (Garcia v. Mojica, G.R. No. 13903, September 10, 1999; Layno v. Sandiganbayan, G.R.

Q: Trinca borrowed P1.5 million from Ida. Trinca executed a promissory note promising to pay Ida in three equal monthly installments. When Trinca failed to pay her obligation, Ida filed an action for recovery of a sum of money against her in the Metropolitan Trial Court of Pasay City. The case was raffled to Judge Risa, who upon reading the complaint, noticed that Trinca and Ida were neighbors in Barangay 189 in Pasay City and that there was no prior referral of the case for barangay conciliation. Hence, Judge Risa dismissed the case motu proprio for failure to comply with a condition precedent. Was the dismissal by Judge Risa proper? Explain your answer. (2023 BAR)
A: NO, the dismissal was not proper. Indeed, R.A. No 7160 provides that barangay conciliation proceedings are a precondition to filing a complaint in court between persons actually residing in the same barangay to explore possible amicable settlement. However, such non-compliance of this condition precedent is non-jurisdictional. This must be invoked by the party-litigant at the earliest opportunity; otherwise, it is deemed waived. Here, the dispute falls within the jurisdiction of the lupon as private citizens Trinca and Ida both actually resided in the same barangay.
However, it appears that Trinca did not object to the filing of the said complaint. Hence, the motu proprio dismissal by the judge is incorrect. (Ngo vs. Gabelo et al., G.R. No. 207707,
24 Aug. 2020) (Divina, 2024)

Q: A suit for injunction is an action in rem. (2009 BAR)
A: FALSE. A suit for injunction is an action in personam. In the early case of Auyong Hian v. Court of Tax Appeals (59 SCRA 110 [1974], it was held that a restraining order, like an injunction, operates upon a person. It is granted in the exercise of equity jurisdiction and has no in rem effect to invalidate an act done in contempt of an order of the court except where by statutory authorization, the decree is so framed as to act in rem on property.

Q: Amorsolo, a Filipino citizen permanently residing in New York City, filed with the RTC of Lipa City a Complaint for Rescission of Contract of Sale of Land against Brigido, a resident of Barangay San Miguel, Sto.
Tomas, Batangas. The subject property, located in Barangay Talisay, Lipa City, has an assessed value of P19,700.00. Appended to the complaint is Amorsolo's verification and certification of non-forum shopping executed in New York City, duly notarized by Mr. Joseph Brown, Esq., a notary public in the State of New York.
Brigido filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court cannot acquire jurisdiction over the person of Amorsolo because he is not a resident of the Philippines xxx
Rule on the foregoing ground. (2009 BAR)
A: The ground that the court cannot acquire jurisdiction over the person of Amorsolo is without merit. The Supreme Court has held that a court acquires jurisdiction over the person of the plaintiff when he files the complaint or petition before the court. (Central Bar Q&A by Riguera,

Q: Lani filed an action for partition and accounting in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila against her sister Mary Rose, who is a resident of Singapore and is not found in the Philippines. Upon motion, the court ordered the publication of the summons for three weeks in a local tabloid, Bulgar.
Linda, an OFW vacationing in the Philippines, saw the summons in Bulgar and brought a copy of the tabloid when she returned to Singapore. Linda showed the tabloid and the page containing the summons to Mary Rose, who said, "Yes I know, my kumare Anita scanned and e-mailed that page of Bulgar to me!"
Did the court acquire jurisdiction over Mary Rose?
(2008 BAR)
A: Partition is an action quasi in rem. Summons by
publication is proper when the defendant does not reside and is not found in the Philippines, provided that a copy of the summons and order of the court are sent by registered mail to the last known address of the defendant (Sec. 15, Rule 14). Publication of the notice in Bulgar, a newspaper of general circulation, satisfies the requirements of summons by publication (Perez vs. Perez, G.R. No 145368, 28 March 2005).

Q: Jose, Alberto and Romeo were charged with murder.
Upon filing of the information, the RTC judge issued the warrants for their arrest. Learning of the issuance of the warrants, the three accused jointly filed a motion for reinvestigation and for the recall of the warrants of arrest. On the date set for hearing of their motion, none of the accused showed up in court for fear of being arrested. The RTC judge denied their motion because the RTC did not acquire jurisdiction over the persons of the movants. Did the RTC rule correctly? (2008 BAR)
A: No, the court acquired jurisdiction over the person of the accused when they filed the aforesaid motion and invoked the court's authority over the case, without raising the issue of jurisdiction over their person.
Their filing the motion is tantamount to voluntary submission to the court's jurisdiction and constitutes voluntary appearance (Miranda v. Tuliao, G.R. No. 158763,
