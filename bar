Q: Give at least three instances where the Court of Appeals may act as a trial court. (2008 BAR)
A: Instances where the Court of Appeals may act as a trial court are:
a) In annulment of judgment under Secs. 5 and 6, Rule
47. Should the Court of Appeals find prima facie merit in the petition, the same shall be given due course and summons shall be served on the respondent, after which trial will follow, where the procedure in ordinary civil cases shall be observed.
b) When a motion for new trial is granted by the Court of Appeals, the procedure in the new trial shall be the same as that granted by a Regional Trial Court (Sec. 4, Rule 53).
c) A petition for habeas corpus shall be set for hearing (Sec. 12, Rule 102).
d) In a petition for the writs of amparo and habeas data, a hearing can be conducted.
e) Under Sec. 12, Rule 124 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Court of Appeals has the power to try cases and conduct hearings, receive evidence and perform any and all acts necessary to resolve factual issues cases which fall within its original and appellate jurisdiction.
f) The Court of Appeals can grant a new trial based on the ground of newly discovered evidence. (Sec. 14, Rule 124).
g) The Court of Appeals, under Section 6, Rule 46, whenever necessary to resolve factual issues, may conduct hearing thereon or delegate the reception of the evidence of such issues to any of its members or to an appropriate agency or office. (UPLC

Q: Distinguish Questions of Law from Questions of Fact.
(2004 BAR)
A: A question of law is when the doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on a certain set of facts, while a question of fact is when the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of alleged facts. (Ramos v. Pepsi-Cola

Q: Goodfeather Corporation, through its President, Al Pakino, filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) a complaint for specific performance against Robert White. Instead of filing an answer to the complaint, Robert White filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground of lack of the appropriate board resolution from the Board of Directors of Good feather Corporation to show the authority of Al Pakino to represent the corporation and file the complaint in its behalf. The RTC granted the motion to dismiss and, accordingly, it ordered the dismissal of the complaint. Al Pakino filed a motion for reconsideration which the
RTC denied. As nothing more could be done by Al Pakino before the RTC, he filed an appeal before the Court of Appeals (CA). Robert White moved for dismissal of the appeal on the ground that the same involved purely a question of law and should have been filed with the Supreme Court (SC). However, Al Pakino claimed that the appeal involved mixed questions of fact and law because there must be a factual determination if, indeed, Al Pakino was duly authorized by Goodfeather Corporation to file the complaint.
Whose position is correct? Explain. (2014 BAR)
A: Al Pakino is correct in claiming that the appeal involved mixed questions of fact and law. There is a question of law when the doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on a certain state of facts. On the other hand, there is a question of fact, when the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of alleged facts. (Mirant Philippines Corporation v. Sario, G.R. No. 197598, 21 Nov. 2012) Since the complaint was dismissed due to the alleged lack of appropriate board resolution from the Board of Directors of Goodfeather Corporation, the appeal will necessarily involve a factual determination of the authority to file the Complaint for the said corporation. Hence, the appeal before the Court of Appeals is correct. (UPLC Suggested Answers)

Q: On July 15, 2009, Atty. Manananggol was served copies of numerous unfavorable judgments and orders.
On July 29, 2009, he filed motions for reconsideration which were denied. He received the notices of denial of the motions for reconsideration on October 2, 2009, a Friday. He immediately informed his clients who, in turn, uniformly instructed him to appeal. How, when and where should he pursue the appropriate remedy for each of the following (2009 BAR):
(a) Judgment of a Municipal Trial Court (MTC) pursuant to its delegated jurisdiction dismissing his client's application for land registration?
A: The judgment of the MTC pursuant to its delegated jurisdiction is appealable to the Court of Appeals by way of a notice of appeal filed on or before 19 October 2009, 17
October (15" day from notice of the denial of the motion for reconsideration) being a Saturday.
This is because under B.P. Blg. 129, the judgment of the MTC in the exercise of its delegated jurisdiction in land registration cases shall be appealable in the same manner as decisions of the RTC. (Sec. 34, B.P. Blg. 129) (Central Bar
Q&A by Riguera, 2024)
(b) Judgment of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) denying his client's petition for a Writ of Habeas Data?
A: The judgment of the RTC denying his client's petition for a Writ of Habeas Data is appealable to the Supreme Court by filing a petition for review on certiorari on or before 09 Oct.
2009, which is the 5th working day from notice. This is pursuant to the SC Rule on the Writ of Habeas Data. (Central Bar Q&A by Riguera, 2024)
(c) Order of a Family Court denying his client's petition for Habeas Corpus in relation to custody of a minor child?
A: The order of the Family Court denying his client's petition for a writ of habeas corpus is appealable to the Court of Appeals by filing a notice of appeal within 48 hours from notice of the order. (Sec. 3, Rule 41, ROC) Since the 48th hour would fall on a Sunday, the notice of appeal may be filed on Monday, 05 Oct. 2009. (Central Bar Q&A by Riguera, 2024)
(d) Order of the RTC denying his client's Petition for Certiorari questioning the Metropolitan Trial Court's (MeTC's) denial of a motion to suspend criminal proceedings?
A: The order of the RTC denying his client's Petition for Certiorari is appealable to the Court of Appeals by filing a notice of appeal on or before 19 Oct. 2009. The RTC's order was rendered in the exercise of its original jurisdiction; hence the appeal is governed by Rule 41.
(e) Judgment of the First Division of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) affirming the RTC decision convicting his client for violation of the National Internal Revenue Code?
A: The judgment of the CTA's First Division affirming the
RTC decision is appealable to the CTA en banc by a petition for review filed on or before 19 Oct. 2009. (Sec. 18, R.A. No.
1125 (CTA Act); Sec. 9(b) Rule 9, Revised CTA Rules)

Q: Does the Court of Appeals have jurisdiction to review the Decisions in criminal and administrative cases of the Ombudsman? (2006 BAR)
A: YES, but only in administrative cases. In administrative and disciplinary cases, appeals from the Ombudsman must be taken to the Court of Appeals under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. Conversely, the Supreme Court has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the Ombudsman in criminal cases. (Lanting v. Ombudsman, G.R. No. 141426, 06 May 2005; Fabian v. Desierto, G.R.

Q: The Ombudsman, after conducting the requisite preliminary investigation, found probable cause to charge Gov. Matigas in conspiracy with Carpintero, a private individual, for violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, as amended). Before the information could be filed with the Sandiganbayan, Gov. Matigas was killed in an ambush. This, notwithstanding, an information was filed against Gov. Matigas and Carpintero.
At the Sandiganbayan, Carpintero through counsel, filed a Motion to Quash the information, on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, arguing that with the death of Gov. Matigas, there is no public officer charged in the information.
Is the Motion to Quash legally tenable? (2014 BAR)
A: NO. No, the motion to quash is not legally tenable. In a case involving similar facts, the Supreme Court held that the death of the public officer did not mean that the allegation of conspiracy between the public officer an? the private person can no longer be proved or that t~eir alleged conspiracy is already expunged. The only thing extinguished by the death of the public officer was his criminal liability.
His death did not extinguish the crime nor did it remove the basis of the charge of conspiracy between him and the private person. Hence the Sandiganbayan had jurisdiction over the offense charged. (People v. Go, G.R. No. 168539, 25 Mar. 2014) (Central Bar Q&A by Riguera, 2024)

Q: The Ombudsman filed an information against City Mayor Isidro for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act before the Sandiganbayan. The information alleged that Mayor Isidro, "an incumbent City Mayor with Salary Grade 30, while in the performance of his official and administrative functions, acting with evident bad faith and manifest partiality, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and criminally give unwarranted benefits to ABC Corporation by allowing it to operate a dumpsite without the necessary environmental permits and clearances causing undue injury to the residents who had to endure the stench, flies, rats and mosquitoes emanating from the dumpsite." Mayor Isidro sought to dismiss the criminal case for lack of jurisdiction and explained that the Regional Trial Court (RTC), not the Sandiganbayan, has authority to decide the controversy.
Which between the Sandiganbayan and the RTC has proper jurisdiction over the criminal case? Explain.
(2024 BAR)
A: As between the Sandiganbayan and the RTC, it is the RTC which has proper jurisdiction over the criminal case.
Under the Law on Sandiganbayan jurisdiction, it is the RTC not the Sandiganbayan which has exclusive original jurisdiction over a violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act committed by a city mayor where the information does not allege any damage to the government or bribery.
Here, the information against Mayor Isidro does not allege any damage to the government or any bribery. Hence, it is the RTC which has exclusive original jurisdiction over the criminal case. (PD 1606 as amended by RA 10660)

Q: Fides filed a case before the Regional Trial Court
(RTC) questioning the authority of the local government unit (LGU) to assess real property taxes (RPT) on a certain property she owns. She also prayed for a writ of preliminary injunction (WPI) to restrain the LGU from collecting the RPT. The LGU moved to dismiss Fides case arguing that since the matter involves RPT, her remedy was to file an appeal to the Local Board of Assessment Appeals. (2022 BAR)
(A) Is the LGU correct? Explain briefly.
A: NO. The LGU is not correct. The Supreme Court has held that an appeal to the Local Board of Assessment Appeals is not required where the taxpayer is questioning the very authority and power of the LGU to assess and collect the real property tax and that a court case in such a situation may be properly resorted to. (Ty v. Trampe, G.R. No. 117577, 01 Dec.
1995) (Central Bar Q&A by Riguera, 2024)
(B) If the RTC issues an order denying the application for a WPI, and thereafter denies Fides' subsequent motion for reconsideration, what is her remedy?
A: Fides remedy is to file a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 with the Court of Tax Appeals. The Supreme Court has held that the remedy of an aggrieved party from an interlocutory order of the RTC in a local tax case is a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 filed with the Court of Tax Appeals.
Here, the order denying the application for a WPI is an interlocutory order since it does not completely dispose of the case. Fides should show that the denial of the application for a WPI was made with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of or excess of jurisdiction.
Hence, Fides remedy is to file a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 with the Court of Tax Appeals. (City of Manila v.

0: Mark filed with the Bureau of Internal Revenue a complaint for refund of taxes paid, but it was not acted upon. So, he filed a similar complaint with the Court of Tax Appeals raffled to one of its Divisions. Mark's complaint was dismissed. Thus, he filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari under Rule 65. Does the Court of Appeals have jurisdiction over Mark's petition? (2006 BAR)
A: NO. The procedure is governed by Sec. 11 of R.A. No. 9282, which provides that decisions of a division of the Court of Tax Appeals must be appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals en banc. Further, the CTA now has the same rank as the Court of Appeals and is no longer considered as a quasi-judicial agency. It is likewise provided in the said law that the decisions of the CTA en banc are cognizable by the Supreme Court under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. (UPLC Suggested Answers)

Q: State at least five (5) civil cases that fall under the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Courts (RTCs). (2016 BAR)
A:
(1) Subject matter of action not capable of pecuniary estimation; (Genesis Investment, Inc. v. Heirs of Ceferino Ebarasabal, G.R. No. 181622, 20 Nov. 2013)
(2) Actions involving title or possession of real property or interest therein where the assessed value exceeds

Q: Rafaelle Beatrice filed an action for recovery of the sum of P2.5 million against Tess in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Taguig City. Attached to the complaint was the promissory note, the check issued by Rafaelle Beatrice to Tess covering said amount, and a copy of the withdrawal slip of Tess from Banco de Otso- Rockwell Branch, Makati City. In her answer, Tess raised as her compulsory counterclaim the recovery of her attorney's fees in the amount of P500,000 arising from the case, and a permissive counterclaim against Rafaelle Beatrice for rescission of contract of sale involving an Arturo Luz painting valued at P2 million.
Tess paid the filing fees of her permissive counterclaim.
Are the counterclaims within the jurisdiction of the RTC of Taguig City? Discuss your answer. (2023 BAR)
A: YES, the counterclaims fall within the jurisdiction of the
RTC. The compulsory counterclaim in the amount of Php 500,000 is within the jurisdiction of the RTC. Since this arose from the original action, it may be considered by the RTC regardless of the amount. (Sec. 7, Rule 6, ROC) As to the permissive counterclaim, since it involves rescission of contract, which is an action incapable of pecuniary estimation, it likewise falls under the jurisdiction of the RTC. (Sec. 19, B.P. Big. 129) (Divina, 2024)
ALTERNATIVE ANSWER:
YES, the counterclaims are within the jurisdiction of the
RTC of Taguig City. The compulsory counterclaims for attorney's fee of P500,000 is within the RTC's jurisdiction.
Under the Law on Civil Procedure, in an original action before the RTC, a compulsory counterclaim is within the jurisdiction of the RTC regardless of its amount. (Sec. 7, Rule 6, ROC)
Here, even if the counterclaim for the attorney's fees was only for P500,000, an amount not exceeding the RTC's jurisdictional amount of P2 million, it is still within the RTC's jurisdiction since it is compulsory. Hence, the counterclaim for attorney's fee of P500,000 is within the RTC's jurisdiction.
The permissive counterclaim for rescission of the contract of sale is also within the RTC's jurisdiction. Under the Law on Civil Procedure, a court has jurisdiction over a permissive counterclaim if it is within the jurisdiction of the court as to its nature. Here, the permissive counterclaim for rescission of a contract of sale is within the RTC's jurisdiction as to its nature because it is an action incapable of pecuniary estimation. That the painting was valued at P2 million is of no moment in the absence of any showing that the principal relief sought was to recover the painting or the amount of P2 million. Hence, the RTC has jurisdiction over the permissive counterclaim. (Central Bar Q&A by Riguera,

Q: Lebron, a Makati resident, obtained a Php
350,000.00 loan from a bank secured by a real estate mortgage (REM) over his lot located in Quezon City with an assessed value of Php 500,000.00. Lebron failed to pay despite written demands. The bank intends to file an action for judicial foreclosure of the REM.
Where should the action for judicial foreclosure of the
REM be filed and in which court? Explain briefly. (2022 BAR)
A: The action should be filed in the RTC of Quezon City.
Under B.P. Big. 129, as amended by R.A. No. 11576, the RTC has jurisdiction over all civil actions involving title to, possession of, or interest in real property, where the assessed value exceeds Php 400,000. Since the foreclosure of mortgage is a real action, it is the assessed value of the property which determines the court's jurisdiction and the location of the property that determines its venue. (Roldan
v. Sps. Barrios, G.R. No. 214803, 23 Apr. 2018) Here, the property in Quezon City is assessed at Php 500,000. Thus, the action for judicial foreclosure should be filed in the RTC of Quezon City. (Divina, 2024)

Q: Santa filed against Era in the RTC of Quezon City an action for specific performance praying for the delivery of a parcel of land subject of their contract of sale. Unknown to the parties, the case was inadvertently raffled to an RTC designated as a special commercial court. Later, the RTC rendered judgment adverse to Era, who, upon realizing that the trial court was not a regular RTC, approaches you and wants you to file a petition to have the judgment annulled for lack of jurisdiction. What advice would you give to Era?
Explain your answer. (2017 BAR)
A: The advice I would give to Era is that the petition for annulment of judgment on lack of jurisdiction will not prosper. It has been held that a special commercial court is still a court of general jurisdiction and can hear and try a non-commercial case. (Concorde Condominium Inc. v.
Baculio, Gr. 203678, 17 Feb. 2016) Hence, the special commercial court has jurisdiction to try and decide the action for specific performance and to render a judgment therein.

Q: Hades, an American citizen, through a dating website, got acquainted with Persephone, a Filipina.
Hades came to the Philippines and proceeded to Baguio City where Persephone resides. Hades and Persephone contracted marriage, solemnized by the Metropolitan Trial Court judge of Makati City. After the wedding, Hades flew back to California, United States of America, to wind up his business affairs. On his return to the Philippines, Hades discovered that Persephone had an illicit affair with Phanes. Immediately, Hades returned to the United States and was able to obtain a valid divorce decree from the Superior Court of the County of San Mateo, California, a court of competent jurisdiction against Persephone. Hades desires to marry Hestia, also a Filipina, whom he met at Baccus Grill in Pasay City. (2015 BAR)
(a) As Hades' lawyer, what petition should you file in order that your client can avoid prosecution for bigamy if he desires to marry Hestia?
A: As Hades' lawyer,
I would file a petition for
cancellation of entry of marriage under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court with prayer for recognition of foreign divorce judgment. In a case involving similar facts, the Supreme Court held that a foreign divorce decree must first be recognized before it can be given effect. The Supreme Court stated that the recognition may be prayed for in the petition for cancellation of the marriage entry under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court.
(Corpuz v. Sto. Tomas, G.R. No. 186571, 11 Aug. 2010)
(b) In what court should you file the petition?
A: I would file the petition in the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, where the corresponding civil registry is located. (Sec. 1, Rule 108, ROC, as amended)
(c) What is the essential requisite that you must comply with for the purpose of establishing jurisdictional facts before the court can hear the petition?
A: For the Rule 108 petition, the jurisdictional facts are the following:
a) Joinder of the local civil registrar and all persons who have or claim any interest which would be affected by petition.
b) Notice of the order of hearing to the persons named in the petition.
c) Publication of the order of hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the province.

Q: Juliet invoking the provisions of the Rule on Violence Against Women and their Children filed with the RTC designated as a Family Court a petition for issuance of a Temporary Protection Order (TPO) against her husband, Romeo. The Family Court issued a 30-day TPO against Romeo. A day before the expiration of the TPO, Juliet filed a motion for extension. Romeo in his opposition raised, among others, the constitutionality of R.A. No. 9262 (The VAWC Law) arguing that the law authorizing the issuance of a TPO violates the equal protection and due process clauses of the 1987 Constitution. The Family Court judge, in granting the motion for extension of the TPO, declined to rule on the constitutionality of R.A. No. 9262. The Family Court judge reasoned that Family Courts are without jurisdiction to pass upon constitutional issues, being a special court of limited jurisdiction, and R.A. No.
8369, the law creating the Family Courts, does not provide for such jurisdiction. Is the Family Court judge correct when he declined to resolve the constitutionality of R.A. No. 9262? (2015 BAR)
A: NO. The Family Court Judge is not correct when it declined to resolve the constitutionality of R.A. No. 9262. In Garcia v. Drilon (G.R. No. 179267, 25 June 2013) the Supreme Court held that the Family Courts have authority and jurisdiction to resolve the constitutionality of a statute.
In spite of its designation as a family court, the RTC remains to possess the authority as a court of general original jurisdiction to pass upon all kinds of cases whether civil, criminal, special proceedings, land registration,
guardianship, naturalization, admiralty or insolvency. This authority is embraced in the general definition of judicial power to determine the valid and binding laws in
conformity with the fundamental law. (UPLC Suggested

Q: Prince Chong entered into a lease contract with King Kong over a commercial building where the former conducted his hardware business. The lease contract stipulated, among others, a monthly rental of P50,000.00 for a four (4)-year period commencing on
01 Jan. 2010. On 01 Jan. 2013, Prince Chong died. Kin II Chong was appointed administrator of the estate of Prince Chong, but the former failed to pay the rentals for the months of January to June 2013 despite King Kong's written demands. Thus, on 01 July 2013, King Kong filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) an action for rescission of contract with damages and payment of accrued rentals as of 30 June 2013.
Can Kin Il Chong move to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the RTC is without jurisdiction since the amount claimed is only P300,000.00? (2014 BAR)
A: NO. Kin Il Chong cannot move to dismiss the Complaint.
An action for rescission of contract with damages and payment of accrued rentals is considered incapable of pecuniary estimation and therefore cognizable by the Regional Trial Court. (Ceferina De Ungria v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 165777, 25 July 2011)

Q: Estrella was the registered owner of a huge parcel of land located in a remote part of their barrio in Benguet.
However, when she visited the property after she took a long vacation abroad, she was surprised to see that her childhood friend, John, had established a vacation house on her property. Both Estrella and John were residents of the same barangay.
To recover possession, Estrella filed a complaint for ejectment with the Municipal Trial Court (MTC), alleging that she is the true owner of the land as evidenced by her certificate of title and tax declaration which showed the assessed value of the property as P21,000.00. On the other hand, John refuted Estrella's claim of ownership and submitted in evidence a Deed of Absolute Sale between him and Estrella. After the filing of John's answer, the MTC observed that the real issue was one of ownership and not of possession. Hence, the MTC dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.
On appeal by Estrella to the Regional Trial Court (RTC), a full-blown trial was conducted as if the case was originally filed with it. The RTC reasoned that based on the assessed value of the property, it was the court of proper jurisdiction. Eventually, the RTC rendered a judgment declaring John as the owner of the land and, hence, entitled to the possession thereof. (2014 BAR)
(a) Was the MTC correct in dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction? Why or why not?
A: NO. It is well settled that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations contained in the complaint. The contention of defendant in his Motion to Dismiss has nothing to do in the determination of jurisdiction.
Relative thereto, the MTCs has exclusive original jurisdiction over cases of forcible entry and unlawful detainer. (Sec. 33, B.P. 129) Hence, the MTC is not correct in dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. At any rate, the rules allow provisional determination of ownership in ejectment cases when the defendant raises the defense of ownership in his pleadings and the question of possession cannot be resolved without deciding the issue of ownership (Sec. 16, Rule 70, ROC, as amended). Accordingly, the inferior courts have jurisdiction to resolve questions of ownership whenever it is necessary to decide the question of possession in an ejectment case. (Serreno v. Sps. Gutierrez, G.R. No. 162366, 10 Nov. 2006)
(b) Was the RTC correct in ruling that based on the assessed value of the property, the case was within its original jurisdiction and, hence, it may conduct a full-blown trial of the appealed case as if it was originally filed with it? Why or why not?
A: NO. It is settled that forcible entry and unlawful detainer cases are within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the first level courts. Moreover, all cases decided by the MTC are generally appealable to the RTC irrespective of the amounts involved. (Secs. 22 and 33, B.P. 129)

Q: Danielle, a Filipino citizen and permanent resident of Milan, Italy, filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Davao City, where she owns a rest house, a complaint for ejectment against Dan, a resident of Barangay Daliao, Davao City. Danielle's property, which is located in Digos City, Davao del Sur, has an assessed value of PhP 25,000. Appended to the complaint was Danielle's certification on non-forum shopping executed in Davao City duly notarized by Atty. Dane Danoza, a notary public
Should the complaint be verified or is the certification sufficient? (2018 BAR)
A: YES. Considering that the action is for unlawful detainer, the Rules on Summary Procedure will apply. Sec. 3(B) of the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure requires that all pleadings submitted to the court be verified; hence, a mere certification on non-forum shopping, the complaint being an initiatory pleading is insufficient.

Q: Laura was the lessee of an apartment unit owned by Louie. When the lease expired, Laura refused to vacate the property. Her refusal prompted Louie to file an action for unlawful detainer against Laura who failed to answer the complaint within the reglementary period.
Louie then filed a motion to declare Laura in default.
Should the motion be granted? Explain your answer.
(2017 BAR)
A: NO. The motion should not be granted because it is a prohibited pleading. Under Sec. 19(h) of the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure, a motion to declare defendant in default is among the pleadings that are prohibited in cases covered by said Rule: Considering that an action for unlawful detainer is covered by the Rules on Summary Procedure, Louie's motion to declare Laura in default is a prohibited pleading, and thus, should not be granted.

Q: Mariano, through his attorney-in-fact, Marcos, filed with the RTC of Baguio City a complaint for annulment of sale against Henry. Marcos and Henry both reside in Asin Road, Baguio City, while Mariano resides in Davao City. Henry filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground of prematurity for failure to comply with the mandatory barangay conciliation. Resolve the motion with reasons. (2009 BAR)
A: The motion to dismiss should be denied because the parties in interest, Mariano and Henry, do not reside in the same city/municipality, or is the property subject of the controversy situated therein.
The required
conciliation/mediation before the proper Barangay as mandated by the Local Government Code governs only when the parties to the dispute reside in the same city or municipality, and if involving real property, as in this case, the property must also be situated in the same city or municipality.

Q: Charged with the offense of slight physical injuries under an information duly filed with the MeTC in Manila which in the meantime had duly issued an order declaring that the case shall be governed by the Revised Rule on Summary Procedure, the accused filed with said court a motion to quash on the sole ground that the officer who filed the information had no authority to do so. The MeTC denied the motion on the ground that it is a prohibited motion under the said Rule. The accused thereupon filed with the RTC in Manila a petition for certiorari in sum assailing and seeking the nullification of the MeTC's denial of his motion to quash. The RTC in due time issued an order on the ground that it is not allowed by the said Rule. The accused forthwith filed with said RTC a motion for reconsideration of its said order. The RTC in time denied said motion for reconsideration on the ground that the same is also a prohibited motion under the said Rule. Were the RTC's orders denying due course to the petition as well as denying the motion for reconsideration, correct?
Reason. (2004 BAR)
A: The RTC's orders denying due course to the petition for certiorari as well as denying the motion for reconsideration are both not correct. The petition for certiorari is a prohibited pleading under Sec. 19(g) of the Revised Rule on Summary Procedure and the motion for reconsideration, while it is not prohibited motion. (Lucas v. Fabros, A.M. No MTJ-99- 1226, 31 Jan. 2000, citing Joven v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 80739 20 Aug. 1992), should be denied because the petition for certiorari is a prohibited pleading. (UPLC
