Q: Distinguish error of jurisdiction from error of judgment. (2012 BAR)
A: An error of jurisdiction is one where the act complained of was issued by the court without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion which is tantamount to lack or in excess of jurisdiction and which error is correctible only by the extraordinary writ of certiorari, while an error of judgment is one in which the court may commit in the exercise of its jurisdiction and is correctible not by certiorari but by appeal. (Villareal v.
Aliga, 13 Jan. 2014) (Central Bar Q&A by Riguera, 2024)

Q: A law was passed declaring Mt. Karbungko as a protected area since it was a major watershed. The protected area covered a portion located in Municipality A of the Province I and a portion located in the City of Z of Province II. Maingat is the leader of Samahan ng Tagapag-ingat ng Karbungko (STK), a people's organization. He learned that a portion of the mountain located in the City of Z of Province II was extremely damaged when it was bulldozed and leveled to the ground, and several trees and plants were cut down and burned by workers of World Pleasure Resorts, Inc. (WPRI) for the construction of a hotel and golf course. Upon inquiry with the project site engineer if they had a permit for the project, Maingat was shown a copy of the Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) issued by the DENR-EMB, Regional Director (RD-DENR-EMB). Immediately, Maingat and STK filed a petition for the issuance of a writ of continuing mandamus against RD-DENR-EMB and WRI with the RTC of Province I, a designated environmental court, as the RD-DENR-EMB negligently issued the ECC to WRI.
On scrutiny of the petition, the court determined that the area where the alleged actionable neglect or omission subject of the petition took place in the City of Z of Province Il, and therefore cognizable by the RTC of Province Il. Thus, the court dismissed outright the petition for lack of jurisdiction.
Assuming that the court did not dismiss the petition, the RD-DENR-EMB in his Comment moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that petitioners failed to appeal the issuance of the ECC and to exhaust administrative remedies provided in the DENR Rules and Regulations.
Should the court dismiss the petition? (2015 BAR)
A: YES. The court should dismiss the petition because the proper procedure to question defect in an ECC is to follow the DENR administrative appeal process in accordance with the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.

Q: Distinguish jurisdiction from venue. (2006 BAR)
A: Jurisdiction is the power of the Court to decide a case on the merits, while venue refers to the place where the suit may be filed. In criminal actions,
however, venue is
jurisdictional. Jurisdiction may not be conferred upon a court by consent through waiver, but venue may be waived except in criminal cases. (Nocum, et al. v. Tan, G.R. No. 145022, 23 Sept. 2005; Santos III v. Northwest Airlines, G.R.

Q: Ulrich is resident and owner of a house and lot situated in Pasay City. Thereafter, Ulrich discovered a deed of real estate mortgage over the house and lot which he supposedly executed to secure a loan from Nigel. The mortgage contract contained a stipulation that "all civil actions arising from or connected with this instrument or any of its provisions shall be brought before the proper courts of Bacolod City, to the exclusion of all other venues of action which are hereby expressly waived." Aggrieved, Ulrich filed against Nigel an action to declare void the spurious deed of real estate mortgage before the Regional Trial Court in Pasay City. In his answer, Nigel raised an affirmative defense that the venue was improperly laid. The action must be filed exclusively in Bacolod City pursuant to the mandatory venue stipulation.
Which between Pasay City and Bacolod City is the proper venue for the action to nullify the deed of real estate mortgage? Explain. (2024 BAR)
A: As between Pasay City and Bacolod City, the proper venue for the action to nullify the deed of real estate mortgage is Pasay City.
The Supreme Court has held that a party is not bound by a venue stipulation if he directly assails the validity of the contract containing the venue stipulation.
Here, Ulrich is directly assailing the validity of the spurious deed of real estate mortgage containing the venue stipulation. Hence, Ulrich is not bound by the venue stipulation providing that the action shall be filed only in Bacolod City. Ulrich can file the action to nullify the mortgage contract in Pasay City where he resides because the action is a personal one. Hence, the proper venue is Pasay City. (Briones v. Cash Asia Credit Corp., 14 January 2015, Perlas-Bernabe, 1)

Q: What do you mean by a) real actions; and b) personal action? (2006 BAR)
A: Real actions are actions affecting title to or possession of real property or an interest therein. All other actions are personal actions. (Sec. 1, Rule 4, ROC, as amended)
=============================================================
Q: Eduardo, a resident of the City of Manila, filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila a complaint for the annulment of a Deed of Real Estate Mortgage he signed in favor of Galaxy Bank (Galaxy), and the consequent foreclosure and auction sale on his mortgaged Makati property. Galaxy filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground of improper venue alleging that the complaint should be filed with the RTC of Makati since the complaint involves the ownership and possession of Eduardo's lot. Resolve the motion with reasons. (2016 BAR)
A: The motion to dismiss should be denied. An action for the annulment of a real estate mortgage is a personal action, which may be commenced and tried where the defendant or any of the defendants resides or may be found, or where the plaintiff or any of the plaintiffs resides or may be found, at the election of plaintiff. (Sec. 2, Rule 4, ROC, as amended;
Chua v. Total Office Products & Services, 30 Sept. 2005;
Orbeta v. Orbeta, G.R. No. 166837, 27 Nov. 2006) Since the plaintiff resides in Manila, the complaint was properly filed in the RTC of Manila.

Q: Distinguish Cause of Action from Action. (1999 BAR)
A: An action is one by which a party sues another for the enforcement or protection of a right, or the prevention or redress of a wrong (Sec. 3(a), Rule 2, ROC, as amended). A cause of action is the act or omission by which a party violates a right of another (Sec. 2, Rule 2, ROC, as amended).
An action must be based on a cause of action (Sec. 1, Rule 2,
ROC, as amended)

Q: A bought a Volvo Sedan from ABC Cars for P 5.0M.
ABC Cars, before delivering to A, had the car rustproofed and tinted by XYZ Detailing. When delivered to A, the car's upholstery was found to be damaged. ABC Cars and XYZ Detailing both deny any liability. Who can A sue and on what cause(s) of action? Explain. (2012 BAR)
A: A can file an action for specific performance and damages against ABC Cars since the damage to the Volvo sedan's upholstery was caused before delivery of the same to A, and therefore prior to the transfer of ownership to the latter.
(Art. 1477, NCC) Under Art. 1170 of the NCC, those who contravene the tenor of the obligation are liable for damages. Hence, an action for specific performance against ABC Corporation to deliver the agreed Volvo Sedan in the contract free from any damage or defects, with corresponding damages will lie against ABC Cars.

Q: Mr. C sued Mr. D for reconveyance of property and damages, claiming that Mr. D, through fraud and forgery, was able to obtain the title to Lot No. 1234, which was previously registered in Mr. C's name. The complaint was filed before the Regional Trial Court.
Instead of filing an answer, Mr. D moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of lack of cause of action. In opposition, Mr. C argued that lack of cause of action is not a ground for a motion to dismiss as the ground provided under Section 1(g), Rule 16 of the Rules of Court is failure to state a cause of action.
Distinguish the concepts of lack of cause of action and failure to state a cause of action. Based on this distinction, is Mr. C's opposition tenable? Explain.
(2019 BAR)
A: Mr. C's opposition is tenable because the ground of lack of cause of action is not among the grounds for a motion to dismiss under Sec. 1(g), Rule 76 of the Rules of Court. Lack of cause of action is different from failure to state cause of action.
Jurisprudence provides that failure to state a cause of action and lack of cause of action are distinct grounds to dismiss a particular action. The former refers to the insufficiency of the allegations in the pleading, while the latter to the insufficiency of the factual basis for the action. Dismissal for failure to state a cause of action may be raised at the earliest stages of the proceedings through a motion to dismiss under Rule 16 of the Rules of Court, while dismissal for lack of cause of action may be raised any time after the questions of fact have been resolved on the basis of stipulations, admissions or evidence presented by the plaintiff.

Q: What is the rule against splitting a cause of action and its effect on the respective rights of the parties for failure to comply with the same? (1999 BAR)
A: The rule against splitting a cause of action and its effect is that if two or more suits are instituted on the basis of the same cause of action, the filing of one or a judgment upon the merits in any one is available as a ground for the dismissal of the others (Sec. 4, Rule 2, ROC, as amended).
=============================================================
Q: Jimuel filed against his wife Jewel a petition for the declaration of nullity of their marriage, alleging as ground therefor Jewel's psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code. The court denied the petition for insufficiency of the evidence presented at the trial. Much later, Jimuel again filed a petition against Jewel for the declaration of nullity of their marriage. This time, the basis of Jimuel's petition was the absence of a marriage license at the time their marriage was celebrated. Upon Jewel's motion, the court dismissed the petition on the ground of res judicata by virtue of the judgment in the first suit.
Was the denial of the petition on the ground of res judicata proper? Explain briefly. (2022 BAR)
A: Yes, the denial of the petition on the ground of res judicata was proper. Under the Rules of Civil Procedure on res judicata, a judgment is conclusive not only with respect to the matter directly adjudged but also as to any other matter that could have been raised in relation thereto. (Sec. 47(b), Rule 39, ROC, as amended) Here, the ground of lack of a marriage license could have been raised by Jimuel in the first petition for declaration of nullity of marriage. Not having been so raised, the judgment in the first case was conclusive as to the validity of the marriage. Hence, the denial of the petition on the ground of res judicata was proper. (Mallion v. Alcantara, G.R. No. 141528, 31 Oct. 2006)
=============================================================
Q: Rolando filed a petition to declare his marriage with Carmela null and void on account of the latter's psychological incapacity. After trial, the court rendered judgment dismissing the petition on the ground that Rolando failed to prove the psychological incapacity of his wife. The judgment having become final, Rolando filed another petition, this time on the ground that his marriage to Carmela had been celebrated without a license. Is the second action barred by the judgment in the first? Why? (2017 BAR)
A: NO, the second action is not barred by the prior judgment because there are different causes of action involved. The first is for annulment of marriage on the ground of psychological incapacity under the Family Code, while the second is for declaration of nullity of the marriage in view of the absence of a marriage license. They are different causes of action because the evidence required to prove them is not the same. As explained by the Court in the case of Yap v.
Chua (G.R. No. 186730, 13 June 2012), the test to determine whether the causes of action are identical is to ascertain whether the same evidence will sustain both actions.

Q: Elise obtained a loan of P3 Million from Merchant Bank. Aside from executing a promissory note in favor of Merchant Bank, she executed a deed of real estate mortgage over her house and lot as security for her obligation. The loan fell due but remained unpaid; hence, Merchant Bank filed an action against Elise to foreclose the real estate mortgage. A month after, and while the foreclosure suit was pending, Merchant Bank also filed an action to recover the principal sum of P3 Million against Elise based on the same promissory note previously executed by the latter. In opposing the motion of Elise to dismiss the second action on the ground of splitting of a single cause of action, Merchant Bank argued that the ground relied upon by Elise was devoid of any legal basis considering that the two actions were based on separate contracts, namely, the contract of loan evidenced by the promissory note, and the deed of real estate mortgage. Is there a splitting of a single cause of action? Explain your answer. (2017 BAR)
A: YES. Yes, there is splitting of a cause of action. Under Rule 2, Sec. 4 of the Rules of Court, if two or more suits are instituted on the basis of the same cause of action, the filing of one is available as a ground for the dismissal of the others.
Here, a civil action for collection of debt and an action to foreclose mortgage are both founded on the debtor's indebtedness to the creditor. Both demands arise from the same cause, the non-payment of the debt, and, for that reason, they constitute a single cause of action. (Bachrach Motor, Inc. v. Esteban Icarañgal and Oriental Commercial Co
Inc., G.R. No. 45350, 29 May 1939) (Divina, 2024)

Q: Raphael, a warehouseman, filed a complaint against V Corporation, X Corporation, and Y Corporation to compel them to interplead. He alleged therein that the three corporations claimed title and right of possession over the goods deposited in his warehouse and that he was uncertain which of them was entitled to the goods.
After due proceedings, judgment was rendered by the court declaring that X Corporation was entitled to the goods. The decision became final and executory.
Raphael filed a complaint against X Corporation for the payment of P100,000.00 for storage charges and other advances for the goods. X Corporation filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground of res judicata. X Corporation alleged that Raphael should have incorporated in his complaint for interpleader his claim for storage fees and advances that for his failure he was barred from interposing his claim. Raphael replied that he could not have claimed storage fees and other advances in his complaint for interpleader because he was not yet certain as to who was liable therefor. Resolve the motion with reasons. (2005 BAR)
A: The motion to dismiss should be granted. Raphael should have incorporated in his complaint for interpleader his claim for storage fees and advances, the amounts of which were obviously determinable at the time of the filing of the complaint. They are part of Raphael's cause of action which he may not split. Hence, when the warehouseman asks the court to ascertain who among the defendants are entitled to the goods, he also has the right to ask who should pay for the storage fees and other related expenses. The filing of the interpleader is available as a ground for dismissal for the second case. (Sec. 4, Rule 2, ROC, as amended). It is akin to a compulsory counterclaim which, if not set up, shall be barred (Sec. 2, Rule 9, ROC, as amended; Arreza v. Diaz, G.R.

Q: AB, as mother and in her capacity as legal guardian of her legitimate minor son, CD, brought action for support against EF, as father of CD and AB's lawfully wedded husband. EF filed his answer denying his paternity with counterclaim for damages.
Subsequently, AB filed a manifestation in court that in view of the denial made by EF, it would be futile to pursue the case against EF. AB agreed to move for the dismissal of the complaint, subject to the condition that EF will withdraw his counterclaim for damages. AB and EF filed a joint motion to dismiss. The court dismissed the case with prejudice. Later on, minor son CD, represented by AB, filed another complaint for support against EF. EF filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of res judicata. Is res judicata a valid ground for dismissal of the second complaint? Explain your answer. (2000 BAR)
A: NO. Res judicata is not a defense in an action for support even if the first case was dismissed with prejudice on a joint motion to dismiss. The plaintiff's mother agreed to the dismissal of the complaint for support in view of the defendant's answer denying his paternity with
counterclaim for damages. This was in the nature of a compromise of the right to support which is prohibited by law. (Art, 2035, NCC; De Asis v. CA, G.R. No. 127578, 15 Feb.

Q: Myrna leased her real property to Geybin for a period of one year. However, Geybin refused to vacate the premises after the expiration of the lease. Myrna then filed against Geybin an unlawful detainer case.
The Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) ruled in favor of Myrna and ordered Geybin to surrender the real property. The judgment of the MeTC lapsed into finality but was not enforced. For humanitarian reasons, Myrna allowed Geybin to stay on the real property provided he will surrender its possession when needed. Thereafter, Myrna demanded from Geybin to vacate the premises but was refused. Myrna filed against Geybin another unlawful detainer case. In his answer, Geybin argued that the second ejectment case is barred by the prior final judgment in the first ejectment case.
Does res judicata bar the institution of the second unlawful detainer case? Explain. (2024 BAR)
A: No, res judicata does not bar the institution of the second unlawful detainer case.
Under the Law on Civil Procedure, res judicata requires that there is identity of cause of action between the first and the second case.
Here, there is no identity of cause of action. The cause of action in the first case was Geybin's refusal to vacate after the expiration of the lease contract, while the cause of action in the second case was Geybin's refusal to surrender possession that was merely being tolerated by Myrna.
Hence, res judicata does not bar the second unlawful detainer case.
=============================================================
Q: What is the rule on joinder of causes of action? (1999 BAR)
A: The rule on joinder of causes of action is that a party may in one pleading assert, in the alternative or otherwise, as many causes of action as he may have against an opposing party, provided that the rule on joinder of parties is complied with; the joinder shall not include special civil actions or actions governed by special rules, but may include causes of action pertaining to different venues or jurisdictions provided one cause of action falls within the jurisdiction of a Regional Trial Court and venue lies therein; and the aggregate amount claimed shall be the test of jurisdiction where the claims in all the causes of action are principally for the recovery of money. (Sec. 5, Rule 2, ROC, as amended)
=============================================================
Q: Give the effects of the following: (1998 BAR)
(a) Splitting a single cause of action; and
A: The effect of splitting a single cause of action is found in the rule as follows: If two or more suits are instituted on the basis of the same cause of action, the filing of one or a judgment on the merits in any one is available as a ground for the dismissal of the others. (Sec. 4, Rule 2, ROC, as amended)
(b) Non-joinder of a necessary party.
A: The effect of the non-joinder of a necessary party may be stated as follows: The court may order the inclusion of an omitted necessary party if jurisdiction over his person may be obtained. The failure to comply with the order for his inclusion without justifiable cause is a waiver of the claim against such party. The court may proceed with the action, but the judgment rendered shall be without prejudice to the rights of such necessary party. (Sec. 9, Rule 3, ROC, as amended)
=============================================================
Q: Pauline and Regine had a dispute over a 500-square meter parcel of land that they inherited from their deceased parents, Milcah and James. During the barangay conciliation proceedings, both Pauline and Regine agreed to partition the lot in equal shares. As a result, the title to the property was cancelled and new titles were issued in favor of Pauline and Regine as to their respective lots. However, Regine discovered that the lot covered by her title was on the eastern portion rather than the northern portion, contrary to their agreement. Hence, Regine filed a "Petition for Annulment of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) and Barangay Partition, with Prayer for Judicial Partition of the Intestate Estate of the Spouses Milcah and James" against Pauline. After trial, the court rendered judgment in favor of Regine. Pauline then consulted a newly-minted lawyer, Atty. Terry, who explained to her that there was a misjoinder of causes of action when Regine included both annulment of TCT and the barangay partition, as well as judicial partition in the petition. Hence, the trial court erred when it ruled on both causes of action instead of dismissing the petition of Regine. Is Atty. Terry correct? Explain. (2023 BAR)
A: NO, Atty. Terry is incorrect. Sec. 6, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court states that misjoinder of causes of action is not a ground for dismissal of an action. Instead, a misjoined cause of action may, on motion of a party or on the initiative of the court, be severed and proceeded with separately. If there is no objection to the improper joinder or the court did not motu
proprio direct a
severance, the court may
simultaneously adjudicate the erroneously joined causes of action, provided it has jurisdiction over all causes of action.
(Ada v. Baylon, G.R. No. 182435, 13 Aug. 2012)
Here, considering that the RTC has jurisdiction over all the causes of action and there appear to be no objection to the misjoinder of the actions, the RTC may simultaneously adjudicate the actions, despite being misjoined. (Divina,

Q: Perry is a resident of Manila, while Ricky and Marvin are residents of Batangas City. They are the co-owners of a parcel of residential land located in Pasay City with an assessed value of P100,000.00. Perry borrowed P100,00.00 from Ricky which promised to pay on or before December 1, 2004. However, Perry failed to pay his loan. Perry also rejected Ricky and Marvin's proposal to partition the property. Ricky filed a complaint against Perry and Marvin in the RTC of Pasay City for the partition of the property. He also incorporated in his complaint his action against Perry for the collection of the latter's P100,000.00 loan, plus interests and attorney's fees. State with reasons whether it was proper for Ricky to join his causes of action in his complaint for partition against Perry and Marvin in the RTC of Pasay City. (2005 BAR)
A: It was not proper for Ricky to join his causes of action against Perry in his complaint for partition against Perry and Marvin. The causes of action may be between the same parties, Ricky and Perry, with respect to the loan but not with respect to the partition which includes Marvin.
Moreover, the supposed joinder includes a special civil action, thus, not allowed under Sec. 5(b), Rule 2 of the Rules of Court. (UPLC Suggested Answers)

Q: A secured two loans from B. One for P500,000.00 and the other for P1,000,000, payable on different dates.
Both have fallen due. Is B obliged to file only one complaint against A for the recovery of both loans?
Explain. (1999 BAR)
A: NO. Joinder is only permissive since the loans are separate loans which may be governed by different terms and conditions. The two loans give rise to two separate causes of action and may be the basis of two separate complaints. (UPLC Suggested Answers)

Q: Zeinab, Glenda, and Rosmar had several business dealings.
Zeinab purchased from Glenda PHP
1,000,000.00 worth of beauty products. On the other hand, Rosmar borrowed from Glenda PHP 2,000,000.00 as additional capital. Zeinab and Rosmar promised to pay their respective obligations to Glenda after one year. On due date, Zeinab paid Glenda only PHP 700,000.00 while Rosmar did not pay any amount despite repeated demands. Aggrieved, Glenda filed a complaint to recover PHP 2,300,000.00 against Zeinab and Rosmar before the Regional Trial Court (RTC). Does the RTC have jurisdiction over the complaint? Explain.
(2024 BAR)
A: No, the RTC does not have jurisdiction over the complaint to recover PHP 2,300,000 against Zeinab and Rosmar.
Under the Totality Rule, where the claims in the causes of action joined are principally for recovery of money, the aggregate amount claimed shall be the test of jurisdiction provided there is a proper joinder of causes of action.
Here, there was no proper joinder of causes of action because there was no proper joinder of parties. The claim against Zeinab and Rosnar did not arise from the same transaction or series of transactions and there was no common question of law or fact in the claims. Since there was no proper joinder of causes of action and the amount of each separate claim did not exceed PHP 2,000,000, the RTC did not have jurisdiction. Hence, the RTC does not jurisdiction over the complaint. (Section 5, Rule 2; Flores v.

Q: Spouses Marlon and Edith have three (3) children ages 15, 12, and 7, who are studying at public schools.
They have a combined gross monthly income of
P30,000.00 and they stay in an apartment in Manila with a monthly rent of P5,000.00. The monthly minimum wage per employee in Metro Manila does not 
exceed P13,000.00. They do not own any real property.
The spouses want to collect a loan of P25,000.00 from Jojo but do not have the money to pay the filing fees.
(2016 BAR)
(a) Would the spouses qualify as indigent litigants under Section 19, Rule 141 on Legal Fees?
A: NO. The spouses would not qualify as indigent litigants under Sec. 19, Rule 141 of the Rules of Court since their combined gross monthly income of P30,000.00 exceeds P26,000, the amount double the monthly minimum wage.
(UPLC Suggested Answers)
(b) If the spouses do not qualify under Rule 141, what other remedy can they avail of under the rules to exempt them from paying the filing fees?
A: The other remedy the spouses can avail of under the rules to exempt them from paying the filing fees is to apply for an exemption pursuant to the "indigency test" under Sec.
21, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court if they can prove that they have no money or property sufficient and available for food, shelter and basic necessities for themselves and their family. (Sps. Algura v. City of Naga, 30 Oct. 2006)

Q: Strauss filed a complaint against Wagner for cancellation of title. Wagner moved to dismiss the complaint because Grieg, to whom he mortgaged the property as duly annotated in the TCT, was not impleaded as defendant. (2015 BAR)
(a) Should the complaint be dismissed?
A: NO. The complaint should not be dismissed because the mere non-joinder of an indispensable party is not a ground for the dismissal of the action. (Sec. 11, Rule 3, ROC, as amended; Republic v. Hon. Mangotara, G.R. No. 170375, 07 July 2010)
(b) If the case should proceed to trial without Grieg being impleaded as a party to the case, what is his remedy to protect his interest?
A: If the case should proceed to trial without Grieg being impleaded as a party, he may intervene in the action. (Sec.
1, Rule 19, ROC, as amended) He may also file a petition for annulment of judgment under Rule 46 of the Rules of Court, should a judgment be already rendered. In Metrobank v. Hon. Floro Alejo, (G.R. No. 141970, 10 Sept. 2001), the Supreme Court held that in a suit to nullify an existing TCT in which a real estate mortgage is annotated, the mortgagee is an indispensable party. In such suit, a decision cancelling the TCT and the mortgage annotation is subject to a petition for annulment of judgment, because the non-joinder of a mortgagee deprived the court of jurisdiction to pass upon the controversy.

Q: X was driving the dump truck of Y along Cattleya Street in Sta. Maria, Bulacan. Due to his negligence, X hit and injured V who was crossing the street. Lawyer L, who witnessed the incident, offered his legal services to
V. V, who suffered physical injuries including a fractured wrist bone, underwent surgery to screw a metal plate to his wrist bone. On the complaint of V, a criminal case for Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Serious Physical Injuries was filed against X before the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Sta. Maria. Atty. L, the private prosecutor, did not reserve the filing of a separate civil action. V subsequently filed a complaint for Damages against X and Y before the Regional Trial Court of Pangasinan in Urdaneta where he resides. In his "Certification Against Forum Shopping," V made no mention of the pendency of the criminal case in Sta.
Maria.
Suppose only X was named as defendant in the complaint for damages, may he move for the dismissal of the complaint for failure of V to implead Y as an indispensable party? (2010 BAR)
A: NO. X may not move for dismissal of the civil action for damages on the contention that Y is an indispensable party who should be impleaded. Y is not an indispensable party but only a necessary party. At any rate, nonjoinder and misjoinder of parties is not a ground for dismissal of actions.

Q: In 1996, Congress passed Republic Act No. 8189, otherwise known as the Voter's Registration Act of 1996, providing for the computerization of elections.
Pursuant thereto, the COMELEC approved the Voter's Registration and Identification System (VRIS) Project.
It issued invitations to pre-qualify and bid for the project. After the public bidding, Fotokina was declared the winning bidder with a bid of P6 Billion and was issued a Notice of Award. But COMELEC Chairman Gener Go objected to the award on the ground that under the Appropriations Act, the budget for the COMELEC's modernization
is only P1 Billion. He
announced to the public that the VRIS project has been set aside. Two Commissioners sided with Chairman Go, but the majority voted to uphold the contract.
Meanwhile, Fotokina filed with the RTC a petition for mandamus to compel the COMELEC to implement the contract. The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), representing Chairman Go, opposed the petition on the ground that mandamus does not lie to enforce contractual obligations. During the proceedings, the majority of the Commissioners filed a manifestation that Chairman Go was not authorized by the COMELEC En Banc to oppose the petition. May the OSG represent Chairman Go before the RTC notwithstanding that his position is contrary to that of the majority? (2002 BAR)
A: YES. The OSG may represent the COMELEC Chairman before the RTC notwithstanding that his position is contrary to that of the majority of the Commission members in the COMELEC. Being an independent office, the hands of the OSG are not shackled to the cause of its client agency. In the discharge of its task, the primordial concern of the OSG is to
"best interest of the government" runs counter to its client agency's position. (COMELEC v. Quijano-Padilla, G.R. No.

In her answer, Ms. B denied any personal liability for the damage caused to Ms. A's car, averring that she merely acquiesced to the advice of her contractor, XYZ Construction Co., to have the concrete fence demolished. Thus, damages, if any, should be collected from it.
Thereafter, Ms. A filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, alleging that Ms. B's statement in her answer is actually a negative pregnant. Ms. B opposed the motion, reiterating her defense in her answer which purportedly rendered judgment on the pleadings improper. Ms. B also moved for the dismissal of the case on the ground of non-joinder of XYZ Construction Co., which she alleged is an indispensable party to the case. Assuming that XYZ Construction Co. is an indispensable party, is its non-joinder a ground for the dismissal of the case? Explain. (2019 BAR)
A: NO. The non-joinder of XYZ Construction Co. as an indispensable party is not a ground for the dismissal of the case. The remedy is to implead the party claimed to be indispensable, considering that the parties may be added by order of the court, on motion of the party, or on its own initiative at any stage of the action. The non-joinder of indispensable parties is not a ground for the dismissal of an action. (Plasabas v. CA, G.R. No. 166519, 31 Mar. 2009)

Q: Hanna, a resident of Manila, filed a complaint for the partition of a large tract of land located in Oriental Mindoro. She impleaded her two brothers John and Adrian as defendants but did not implead Leica and Agatha, her two sisters who were permanent residents of Australia. Arguing that there could be no final determination of the case without impleading all indispensable parties, John and Adrian moved to dismiss the complaint.
Does the trial court have a reason to deny the motion?
Explain your answer. (2017 BAR)
A: YES. The trial court has reason to deny the motion. Sec. 11, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court states that neither misjoinder nor non-joinder of parties is a ground for the dismissal of an action. The petitioner can still amend his initiatory pleading in order to implead Leica and Agatha, for under the same rule, such amendment to implead an indispensable party may be made on motion of any party or on the trial court's own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just.

Q: Distinguish a derivative suit from a class suit. (2005
BAR) 
A: A derivative suit is a suit in equity that is filed by a minority shareholder on behalf of a corporation to redress wrongs committed against it, for which the directors refuse to sue, the real party in interest being the corporation itself.
(Lim v. Lim-Yu, G.R. No. 138343, 19 Feb. 2001) A class suit is filed on behalf of many persons so numerous that it is impracticable to join all as parties. (Sec. 12, Rule 3, ROC, as amended)

Q: What is the effect of the death of a party upon a pending action? (1999 BAR)
A: When the claim in a pending action is purely personal, the death of either of the parties extinguishes the claim and the action is dismissed. When the claim is not purely personal and is not thereby extinguished, the party should be substituted by his heirs or his executor or administrator.
(Sec. 16, Rule 3, ROC, as amended) If the action is for recovery of money arising from contract, express or implied, and the defendant dies before entry of final judgment in the court in which the action was pending at the time of such death, it shall not be dismissed but shall instead be allowed to continue until entry of final judgment. A favorable judgment obtained by the plaintiff shall be enforced in the manner provided in the rules for prosecuting claims against the estate of a deceased person. (Sec. 20, Rule 3, ROC, as amended)

Q: Chika sued Gringo, a Venezuelan, for a sum of money.
The Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila (MeTC) rendered a decision ordering Gringo to pay Chika
P50,000.00 plus legal interest. During the pendency of the appeal before the RTC, Gringo died of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Atty. Perfecto, counsel of Gringo, filed a manifestation attaching the death certificate of Gringo and informing the RTC that he cannot substitute the heirs since Gringo did not disclose any information on his family. As counsel for Chika, what remedy can you recommend to your client so the case can move forward, and she can eventually recover her money? Explain. (2016 BAR)
A: As counsel for Chika, I would recommend the filing of a petition for the settlement of the estate of Gringo and for the appointment of an administrator or executor. Rule 3, Sec.16 of the Rules of Court provides that if no legal representative is named by the counsel for the deceased party, the court may order the opposing party to procure the appointment of an executor or administrator for the estate of the deceased and the latter shall immediately appear for and on behalf of the deceased. (Sec. 16, Rule 3, ROC) (Divina, 2024)

Q: Prince Chong entered into a lease contract with King Kong over a commercial building where the former conducted his hardware business. The lease contract stipulated, among others, a monthly rental of P50,000.00 for a four (4)-year period commencing on
01 Jan. 2010. On 01 Jan. 2013, Prince Chong died. Kin II Chong was appointed administrator of the estate of Prince Chong, but the former failed to pay the rentals for the months of January to June 2013 despite King Kong's written demands. Thus, on 01 July 2013, King Kong filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) an action for rescission of contract with damages and payment of accrued rentals as of 30 June 2013.
If the rentals accrued during the lifetime of Prince Chong, and King Kong also filed the complaint for sum of money during that time, will the action be dismissible upon Prince Chong's death during the pendency of the case? (2014 BAR)
A: NO. The action is not dismissible upon Prince Chong's death during the pendency of the case. When the action is for recovery of money arising from a contract, and
defendant dies before entry of final judgment in the court in which the action was pending at the time of such death, it shall not be dismissed but shall instead be allowed to continue until entry of final judgment. A favorable judgment obtained by the plaintiff shall be enforced under Rule 86 (Sec. 20, Rule 3) Relative thereto, since the complaint for sum of money filed by King Kong survives the death of Prince Chong, the case shall not be dismissed and the Court shall merely order the substitution of the deceased defendant. (Sarsaba v. Vda. De Te, G.R. No. 175910, 30 July 2009)

Q: PJ engaged the services of Atty. ST to represent him in a civil case filed by OP against him which was docketed as Civil Case No. 123. A retainership agreement was executed between PJ and Atty. ST whereby PJ promised to pay Atty. ST a retainer sum of P24,000.00 a year and to transfer the ownership of a parcel of land to Atty. ST after the presentation of PJ's evidence. PJ did not comply with his undertaking. Atty.
ST filed a case against PJ which was docketed as Civil
Case No. 456. During the trial of Civil Case No. 456, PJ died. (2000 BAR)
(a) Is the death of PJ a valid ground to dismiss the money claim of Atty. ST in Civil Case No. 456?
Explain.
A: NO. Under Sec. 20, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, when the action is for recovery of money arising from contract, express or implied, and the defendant dies before entry of final judgment in the court in which the action is pending at the time of such death, it shall not be dismissed but shall instead be allowed to continue until entry of final judgment.
A favorable judgment obtained by the plaintiff shall be enforced in the manner especially provided in the Rules for prosecuting claims against the estate of the deceased person. (UPLC Suggested Answers)
(b) Will your answer be the same with respect to the real property being claimed by Atty. ST in Civil Case No. 456? Explain.
A: YES. An action to recover real property in any event survives the death of the defendant. (Sec. 1, Rule 87, ROC, as amended) However, a favorable judgment may be enforced in accordance with Sec. 7(b), Rule 39 of the Rules of Court against the executor or administrator or successor in interest of the deceased.
